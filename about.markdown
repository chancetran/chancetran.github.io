I am a skilled engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley, and have extensive experience in technical integration and engineering. As a Partner Engineer at Uber, I led key integration efforts for the company's delivery ecosystem, collaborating with strategic partners to ensure compatibility and functionality through APIs, SDKs, and other tools. With a strong background in software development, I have worked with technologies such as Python, Golang, Airflow, and Kubernetes to optimize processes and improve business outcomes. I am passionate about leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and data-driven models to drive innovation and enhance operational efficiency.
